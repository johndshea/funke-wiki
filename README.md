# Project Two - John Shea

Link: https://funke-wiki.herokuapp.com/

TODO:

* Write readme

* To build draft voting:
Every time a vote comes in,
a) add the appropriate vote
b) add upvotes to downvotes
c) if total votes is greater than a certain threshold, check ratio. if both check out,
d) set currentversion = the winning draft (use splice so as to remove the draft from the drafts array)
e) move currentversion to the archive

WISH LIST:

* allow authors to lock articles from others' editing?

* sessions are not persistent across server restarts by default. Check the express-session page for ways to do it.

BUGS:

* article tabs menu cuts off navbar drop shadow - use CSS to move it down?

You used to console log me errors.
Late night when you need my help.
Console log me errors.
Late night when you need my help.
And I know when that server ping.
That could only mean one thing.
I know when that server ping. That could only mean one thing.
Ever since I started coding you.
Been rendering all them pages by yourself now.
Everybody knows and I feel left out.
Server just went down you got me stressed out.
You used to console log me errors...
